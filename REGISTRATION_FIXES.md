# Registration Error Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded User Name in Navigation**
**Problem:** In `SignUpOTPScreen`, the code was passing a hardcoded `'username'` string instead of the actual user name.

**Fix:** Changed to use `widget.userData['fullName'] ?? 'User'`

### 2. **Missing Authentication Verification**
**Problem:** User data was being saved before ensuring authentication was complete.

**Fix:** Added authentication checks before saving user data to Firestore.

### 3. **Error Handling**
**Problem:** Errors during sign-up weren't being caught or displayed properly.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages.

### 4. **Firestore Save Issues**
**Problem:** No retry logic or validation when saving to Firestore.

**Fix:** Added retry logic (3 attempts) and field validation before saving.

## Changes Made

### `lib/pages/login.dart`

1. **SignUpOTPScreen.saveUserData()**
   - Added 500ms delay to ensure authentication completes
   - Added authentication check before saving
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Fixed userName in navigation to use actual user data

2. **_SignUpScreenState.saveUserData()**
   - Added 500ms delay to ensure authentication completes
   - Added authentication check before saving
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Added better error messages

3. **Auto-verification error handling**
   - Added try-catch for saveUserData() separately
   - Show error to user if save fails
   - Prevent navigation if save fails

### `lib/services/auth_service.dart`

1. **saveUserData() method**
   - Added field validation (username, fullName, email, phoneNumber)
   - Added 'name' field as requested (duplicates fullName)
   - Added retry logic (3 attempts with 500ms delay)
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
   - Better error messages

2. **checkUserExists() method**
   - Changed to check by phone number first
   - Verify username and userType match
   - More reliable user checking

## Firestore Document Structure

After sign-up, each user will have a document at `/users/{uid}` with:

```dart
{
  'uid': string,              // User's Firebase Auth UID
  'username': string,         // Username chosen during sign-up
  'name': string,            // Full name (as requested)
  'fullName': string,        // Full name (duplicate)
  'email': string,           // Email address
  'phoneNumber': string,     // Phone number
  'userType': string?,       // Employer/Employee (set later)
  'createdAt': timestamp,    // Server timestamp
  'updatedAt': timestamp?    // Server timestamp (when updated)
}
```

## Error Handling

All errors are now handled gracefully:

1. **Invalid Input:** Validates all required fields before saving
2. **Authentication Issues:** Checks if user is authenticated before saving
3. **Network Failures:** Retries up to 3 times with delays
4. **UI Feedback:** Shows error messages to users in SnackBars

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test sign-up flow end-to-end
2. Verify user data appears in Firestore console
3. Test with invalid credentials
4. Test with no internet connection
5. Verify error messages display correctly

## Important Notes

- No existing Firestore collections or data are modified
- New collections are created safely
- All UI elements remain unchanged
- Firebase connection configuration unchanged
- All operations respect existing Firebase project (kalmghar-947b0)

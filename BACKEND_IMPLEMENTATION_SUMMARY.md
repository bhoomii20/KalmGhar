# Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented backend functionality for KalmGhar Flutter app with Firebase (Firestore + Authentication).

## Files Created

### 1. `lib/services/auth_service.dart`
A centralized authentication service that handles:
- User data saving to Firestore with UID as document ID
- User type updates (Employer/Employee)
- Getting current user data
- Checking if user exists
- Sign out functionality

### 2. `lib/services/firestore_service.dart`
A centralized Firestore service that handles:
- Saving job postings to the `feed` collection
- Fetching jobs from Firestore (real-time stream)
- Saving bookings to the `bookings` collection
- Fetching user-specific bookings from Firestore
- Getting/updating user profiles

## Files Updated

### 1. `lib/pages/login.dart`
- Integrated `AuthService` for user data management
- Updated `_checkUserExists()` to use AuthService
- Updated both `saveUserData()` functions to use AuthService
- Proper user data saved to Firestore with fields: `uid`, `username`, `fullName`, `email`, `phoneNumber`, `userType`, `createdAt`

### 2. `lib/pages/feed.dart`
- Integrated `FirestoreService` for job management
- Replaced hardcoded job data with Firestore stream
- Added real-time updates using `StreamBuilder`
- Updated `PostJobPage` to save jobs to Firestore
- Added validation and error handling for posting jobs

### 3. `lib/pages/bookings.dart`
- Integrated `FirestoreService` for booking management
- Removed hardcoded booking data
- Added real-time fetching of user bookings
- Added `initState()` to load user profile and determine user type
- Automatically fetches bookings based on user type (Employer/Employee)

### 4. `lib/pages/roles.dart`
- Integrated `AuthService` for role management
- Updated `_updateUserRole()` to save user type to Firestore
- User type properly saved when user selects Employer or Employee role

## Firestore Collections Structure

### `users` Collection
```dart
{
  uid: string (document ID),
  username: string,
  fullName: string,
  email: string,
  phoneNumber: string,
  userType: string (Employer/Employee),
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### `feed` Collection (Jobs)
```dart
{
  id: string (document ID),
  title: string,
  description: string,
  location: string,
  date: string,
  time: string,
  price: string,
  userId: string,
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### `bookings` Collection
```dart
{
  id: string (document ID),
  employer_id: string,
  employee_id: string,
  service: string,
  scheduledOn: string/timestamp,
  time: string,
  amount: string,
  userId: string,
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

## Features Implemented

### Authentication
✅ Sign up saves user data to Firestore `users` collection
✅ Sign up stores user profile with UID as document ID
✅ Login verifies user exists in Firestore
✅ User type (Employer/Employee) is tracked and stored
✅ Error handling for authentication operations

### Feed (Jobs)
✅ Replaced hardcoded feed data with Firestore data
✅ Real-time stream of jobs from `feed` collection
✅ Post Job functionality saves to Firestore
✅ Jobs fetched and displayed dynamically
✅ Error handling for job posting

### Bookings
✅ Bookings stored in Firestore `bookings` collection
✅ User-specific bookings retrieval
✅ Automatic user type detection for filtering
✅ Real-time updates when bookings change
✅ Error handling for booking operations

## Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up:**
   - User enters username, full name, phone, email
   - OTP verification via Firebase Auth
   - User data saved to Firestore with `uid` as document ID
   - Role selection screen appears
   - User selects Employer or Employee role
   - User type saved to Firestore
   - Profile completion for job seeker or employer

2. **Login:**
   - User enters username, phone, and selects user type
   - System verifies user exists in Firestore
   - OTP verification via Firebase Auth
   - User navigated to home screen

## Data Flow

### Job Posting
1. User fills job details in PostJobPage
2. Data validated
3. Saved to Firestore `feed` collection
4. Feed page automatically updates via StreamBuilder

### Booking Creation
1. User creates a booking
2. Booking saved to Firestore `bookings` collection
3. Includes employer_id, employee_id, service details
4. Bookings page displays user-specific bookings

## Security Notes

- All Firestore operations use authenticated user's UID
- User-specific data queries filter by current user
- No hardcoded user IDs or test data in production flow

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test sign-up flow with different user types
2. Test job posting and display in feed
3. Test booking creation and retrieval
4. Test error handling (network issues, invalid data)
5. Verify Firestore collections are created properly
6. Test real-time updates work correctly

## Important Notes

- The Firebase project ID is: `kalmghar-947b0`
- UI layout and design were NOT modified (as requested)
- Firebase connection remains intact
- All UI widgets are preserved
- Only backend logic was added/updated

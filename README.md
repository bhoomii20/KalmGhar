PROBLEM STATEMENT :
India's rural and agricultural sectors struggle to connect laborers with employers, leading to unemployment. Existing platforms fail to provide timely access to regular or one day domestic help, and emergency service providers like electricians and plumbers are often unavailable when needed.
 
ABSTRACT :
Kalmghar is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between individuals in need of daily help and skilled workers such as electricians, plumbers, and domestic helpers. The platform provides a space where service providers and employers can connect easily based on location, availability, and skill. It especially focuses on rural and semi-urban areas in Goa, where employment opportunities and accessibility to services remain limited. The app enables users to book workers for one-time or short-term tasks, making it ideal for busy households and emergency situations. Kalmghar empowers rural laborers by giving them visibility and regular job opportunities, thus reducing underemployment. It also encourages practical skill development by giving value to trade work. With an easy-to-use interface, it ensures quick access to essential services at the doorstep. By facilitating flexible work arrangements, it supports the gig economy in rural settings. Overall, Kalmghar promotes self-reliance and improves livelihoods while ensuring convenient service for users.
